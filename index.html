       A free-to-play (F2P) action role playing game (ARPG) from Grinding Gear Games (GGG)
       </h2>
       <p>
      Path of Exile is a dark and gritty ARPG that follows in the footsteps of the genre defining classics Diablo and Diablo 2. Content is released on a roughly three month basis with a challenge league where everybody starts from scratch and plays the game from an equal footing. Alternatively players can choose to play the "standard" playmode which is persitant and does not reset but will then miss out of the challenge league and the new content that added. However as well as new challenge leagues a large expansion is released every year or so which affects all game modes and can be enjoyed by players on all of them.
        </p>
      You control a single character from an isometric viewpoint earning experience to level your character up and collecting and upgrading gear. You can team up in parties of up to six people or play solo based on your preference. Players on a server can see each other in the main town but areas you explore are instanced so only available to you and your party. These instances are procedurally generated adding additional replayability. At first you will play through the campaign which follows the exile you play fighting their way through the dark and dangerous world of Wraeclast. Once the main campaign is complete you unlock the end game of POE which is access to maps which take the player to more procedurally generated instances where you fight monsters of a higher and higher level gaining more experience, better loot, and eventually access to many different end game bosses.  
      
      <p>
      There are seven classes in total, Duelist, Marauder, Ranger, Scion, Shadow, Templar and Witch, each having a different starting point on the passive skill tree. This skill tree adds a huge level of complexity which in turn allows a lot of replaybility. Each class can further pick an ascendancy which grant specialised bonuses.

      <p>
        The skill system in POE is based on gems which is reminiscent of Final Fantasy VII's materia system which requires skills to be socketed into gear and then supported by other "support" gems which are linked to that skill gem.

      Rather than gold which is a normal staple of the genre POE makes use of "currency items" which drop when enemies are killed. These items can be traded with other players and form the basis for the in-game economy which has a lot of depth although maybe not to the degree of some games like EVE online but nevertheless important for many of the players. These currency items are used to craft items therefore building in a natural currency sink which combats inflation and is also the reason the in game economy is important to end game players as acquiring a lot of the rarer currency items is key to crafting the best gear.     
     
      <p>
        These systems add multiple layers of complexitity to the game and allow for a lot of customisation where there are multiple ways to build a character using different passives from the skill tree, different skill gems and links, and different items for each gear slot with a huge variety of attributes that all used together can make a powerful character able to take on all the challenges Wraeclast has to offer!
